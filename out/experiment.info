experimentID name irbID directory Description Outcome
1 gl1 1 data2/globloc/gl1 From Fayette, first attempt to see if we could get individual differences and dominance in global/local judgments with nested stimuli.   Mistake in unsigned int mistake in code for responses 
2 as1 1 data2/inh1/as1 Pro (arrow) and anti (circle) saccade task with 1-4 numbers as targets Unsigned response error. Fixed and changed to as2. 
3 as2 1 data2/inh1/as2  NA
4 gl2 1 data2/globloc/gl2 Same as gl1. Fixed response unsigned int bug. NA
5 sj1 1 data2/inh1/sj1 Stroop judgment task: Varying the number of R, G, B pixels in the words Red, Green, Blue Running. Size of effects not as big as we were looking for.
6 acstr1 1 data2/inh1/acstr1  NA
7 acstr2 1 data2/inh1/acstr2  NA
8 acstr3 1 data2/inh1/acstr3 Newest version of Acstr experiment. Fixed timing issue from before. NA
9 as3 1 data2/inh1/as3 Anti-Saccade task: Pro saccade condition now has a circle which is flashed and then replaced by the target. NA
10 acstr4 1 data2/inh1/acstr4 Changed timings, lengthened warmup times NA
11 as4 1 data2/inh1/as4 Changed congruent stim display time from 9 to 7 NA
12 acstr5 1 data2/inh1/acstr5 Made half the congruent trials more difficult by changing word presence duration from 25 to 20 frames. NA
