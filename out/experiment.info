experimentID name memberID irbID directory Description Outcome
1 gl1 NA 1 data2/globloc/gl1 From Fayette, first attempt to see if we could get individual differences and dominance in global/local judgments with nested stimuli.   Mistake in unsigned int mistake in code for responses 
2 as1 NA 1 data2/inh1/as1 Pro (arrow) and anti (circle) saccade task with 1-4 numbers as targets Unsigned response error. Fixed and changed to as2. 
3 as2 NA 1 data2/inh1/as2  NA
4 gl2 NA 1 data2/globloc/gl2 Same as gl1. Fixed response unsigned int bug. NA
5 sj1 NA 1 data2/inh1/sj1 Stroop judgment task: Varying the number of R, G, B pixels in the words Red, Green, Blue Running. Size of effects not as big as we were looking for.
6 acstr1 NA 1 data2/inh1/acstr1  NA
7 acstr2 NA 1 data2/inh1/acstr2  NA
8 acstr3 NA 1 data2/inh1/acstr3 Newest version of Acstr experiment. Fixed timing issue from before. NA
9 as3 NA 1 data2/inh1/as3 Anti-Saccade task: Pro saccade condition now has a circle which is flashed and then replaced by the target. NA
10 acstr4 NA 1 data2/inh1/acstr4 Changed timings, lengthened warmup times NA
11 as4 NA 1 data2/inh1/as4 Changed congruent stim display time from 9 to 7 NA
12 acstr5 NA 1 data2/inh1/acstr5 Made half the congruent trials more difficult by changing word presence duration from 25 to 20 frames. NA
13 acstr6 NA 1 data2/inh1/acstr6 Changed to increase discrepancy between the two congruent case speeds NA
14 numstr1 NA 1 data2/inh1/numstr1 First implementation NA
15 as5 NA 1 data2/inh1/as5 White circle instead of arrow. Different blank times for congruent(5) and incongruent(18) before target presentation. NA
16 numstr2 NA 1 data2/inh1/numstr2 Changed to 17 and 13 frames NA
17 as6 NA 1 data2/inh1/as6 Same as as5 except blank times for congruent(5) and incongruent(20) before target presentation. Running till end of spring quarter to correlate with acstr7 NA
18 acstr7 NA 1 data2/inh1/acstr7 Same as acstr6, changed name for the sake of easily correlating with as6 NA
19 morph1 NA 1 /data2/inh2/morph1 First experiment with morphed stimuli from A to H.  Question is whether we can see large inhibition effects when feedback is provided.  This is a pilot expt that will have several versions under the same expt name NA
20 brightness1 NA 1 specl-exp/data2/inh2/brightMorph1 pilot experiment for flanker brightness task NA
21 morph2 NA 1 specl-exp/data2/inh2/brightMorph1 pilot experiment for morph-flanker task NA
22 efRsvp1 10 1 data2/ssvep/efRsvp1 First RSVP experiment. Flicker frequencies are 2 (target) and 3 (flankers). Targets are clear A and H.  THIS IS A PILOT NA
